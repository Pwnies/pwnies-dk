We started by stepping through the binary at random with gdb. The main function
at 0x403dca seemed more or less linear -- it looped a bit around
0x404a5d-0x404c9f and again around 0x404d44-0x404fb0.

We noticed that fputc was only called from two layers of wrappers, with the
outer wrapper being at 0x400864. This function is called at lot, but all the
places looks something like this:

```objdump
404624: 41 be 50 00 00 00   mov    r14d,0x50
40462a: 41 50               push   r8
40462c: 41 51               push   r9
40462e: 4c 89 f7            mov    rdi,r14
404631: 49 89 c7            mov    r15,rax
404634: e8 2b c2 ff ff      call   my_fputc
404639: 49 89 c6            mov    r14,rax
40463c: 4c 89 f8            mov    rax,r15
40463f: 48 83 c4 00         add    rsp,0x0
404643: 41 59               pop    r9
404645: 41 58               pop    r8
```

However, we also notice, that this function is only called from three places:

From 0x404624 to 0x4049f6 it outputs "Please enter your password: "
From 0x40576f to 0x405903 it outputs "Correct!\n"
From 0x40593a to 0x405a72 it outputs "Wrong!\n"

We see that just before the correct path there is a comparison, which
conditionally will take us to the wrong-path:

```objdump
405751: 4c 8b 7d a8         mov    r15,QWORD PTR [rbp-0x58]
405755: 4c 89 7d a0         mov    QWORD PTR [rbp-0x60],r15
405759: 44 8b 7d a0         mov    r15d,DWORD PTR [rbp-0x60]
40575d: 41 83 ff 00         cmp    r15d,0x0
405761: 0f 84 cb 01 00 00   je     wrong_branch
```


We notice that [rbp-0x58] is set to 0 just after the second loop at 0x404fb0 and
is only set to 1 after that at 0x405736, and that this branch can only be
reached if the lower 4 bytes of 9 qwords stored on the heap (pointer at
[rbp-0x50]) are the following magic values:

```text
0x247bfb03
0x8c33e4bb
0xd49d047b
0x7303fc73
0x8c950303
0x2304743b
0x64647303
0xa454949b
0xd48cb5db
```

By running the binary with different passwords and looking at the bytes, we
notice the pattern, that only 8 bits are altered for each byte of the
password. While the relation is likely simple, we see that we have enough
information to brute-force the password and start writing some [hackish
gdb-shell-python hybrid](http://pwnies.dk/public/files/cone.tar.bz2).
